A physics Solver, based on John Buffer's one (see at https://github.com/johnBuffer/VerletSFML ).

> How to launch ?
- Install SDL2 with 'sudo apt install libsdl2-dev'
- Install SDL2_Image with 'sudo apt install libsdl2-image-dev'
- Compile with 'make'
- Launch with ./physicSolver

> Commands :
- 'SPACE' to set your mouse as an attraction point
- '+' to increase the attractive force
- '-' to decrease the attractive force
- 'n' to begin the next step of the simulation
- 'ECHAP' to quit
- You can move with your mouse / mouse wheel

> Principle
- The simulation use determinated physics. So, unless you're modifying something with the commands, each simulations will be identical to the others. If you play the simulation from the beginning to the end without touching anything, you will get an example.
